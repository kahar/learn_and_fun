clean, build and run whole project ( gradlew clean build run )

02 - Project: Electronic Life - from Eloquent JavaScript 2nd edition - but in Java

For the sake of simplicity, logs are only displayed in the terminal for a certain number of world rounds with some
limitations

TODO list:

- maybe some better way of displaying
- removing the World class or breaking the Grid class into smaller classes
- upgrade project structure
- add some tests
