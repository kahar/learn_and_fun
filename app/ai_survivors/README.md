It's working version for Genetic Algorithm withg Neural Network.  
It's fast and dirty for now :).

Inspiration from:  
https://github.com/kareemaly/gann-service  
https://github.com/davidrmiller/biosim4  
In this code, fragments from electronic life was used.

From time when I saw results for biosim4 I wanted write something like this but with Java :).

TODO:

- clean code
- write better breeding / dying mechanism - for genetic purposes
- write new mode for this game: i.e. new game of life, or something simillar
  to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM (creatures starts from the edge)
- understand Deeplearning4j and neural network more deeply
