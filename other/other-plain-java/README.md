package io.github.kahar.aggregate.visit contains example how to build aggregate Visit from events (which base on Visit
entity from petclinic). I ignore few event releated problems e.g. order and uniques of events  
TODO list for visit:

- use json-patch to update
- perhaps some controller, and real use of repo
- solve ignored problems (order and uniques of events)
- handle persistence in some way
